# My-Uncle-s-PSX-Games
My uncle's father bought him a PSone, with LOTS of games years ago, and when he grew up he gave it to me. i decided to burn them, because if i dont save them in time, they might get damaged or corrupted. i didn't burn all of them since it would be like more than 20GB and nobody would play them.
